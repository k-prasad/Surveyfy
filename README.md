A Survey Web App.

How to Run the Web App:

- Clone/Downlaod the project
- Remove node_modules folder
- Run "npm install" command
- Install client dependencies for mongoose database to run the app and connect to local database


How to Run Tests:

- Note: The commands work based on your directory/workspace structure. So, use 'cd' command appropriately to navigate directory structure

- Use 'cd' command from root directory to move to another directory i.e. cd tests/
- Run test:
- Once you are in tests/ folder run i.e. mocha user.test.js in command/terminal
- Similarly, test for other cases using i.e. mocha option.test.js (example)

Mocha: 

- Mocha, a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js has been used to write test cases for the project.
Asynchronous testing is done. Tests are run serially.

- Mocha utilizes a library called "Chai"
